### 1. Project Purpose
It isn't uncommon for people of any age to start investing these days. However, the stock market trend is unpredictable and doesn't increase every year, resulting in many investors losing hundreds or thousands of dollars. This level of volatility may seem intimidating especially for those who just started investing, which is why we came up with this project to give people a better understanding of how the stock market might work.


With the use of Data Science and Machine Learning, we hope to: 
   1. Achieve a better understanding of the stock market
   2. Give a visualisation of the past year's stock market trend 
   3. Decrease the uncertainty of trends by using machine learning

This project is for **only** for research purposes, therefore it's advisable for users to not only rely on this project to predict the stock market trend.
